# No-More-Motes

Tired of mass farming low/mid tier iod bams only to have your game lag and freezing due to the amount of hp/mp motes?

Well not anymore!

Wow... that was cringy, anyways `!nmm`(or just `nmm` if in proxy chat) toggles the module on or off, by default its on

Added a mode to block mystic motes, togglable with `!nmm mystic` or just `nmm mystic` if in proxy chat
